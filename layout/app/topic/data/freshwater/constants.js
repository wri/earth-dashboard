        <p>
            Almost half of humanity (3.6 billion people) lives in areas likely to run short 
            of water at least one month a year. By withdrawing more water than the land can naturally 
            replenish, we have created humanitarian crises and security risks <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paullaudicina/2018/06/07/water-day-zero-coming-to-a-city-near-you/#5df9cd5c1738" target="_blank">around the world</a>. 
            From Bangalore to Beijing, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/africa/cape-town-day-zero-crisis-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Cape Town</a> 
            to California and Melbourne to Mexico City water shortages and even rationing are commonplace. 
            Nature is suffering, too, with freshwater species declining faster than their ocean or forest
             cousins—<a href="https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/freshwater" target="_blank">by 84%, on average</a>, since 1970. 
        </p>,
        <p>
            Food demand is driving the water deficit, with agriculture responsible for 
            <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture#:~:text=In%20most%20regions%20of%20the,percent%20increase%20in%20water%20withdrawals." target="_blank">70% of freshwater use</a>. 
            At the same time, climate change is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paullaudicina/2018/06/07/water-day-zero-coming-to-a-city-near-you/#5df9cd5c1738" target="_blank">altering the quantity and timing of water flows</a>, 
            leading to more severe droughts and floods and complicating conservation efforts. 
            Our pool of usable water is also shrinking due to pollution from farms and industry that is 
            <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox/FMfcgxwJXpNbgJXPBmflxKgvvzgpFRhW?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1">triggering chemical overload</a> and coastal dead zones. In just 10 years from now, WRI projects, the world’s water supply will fall 56% short of human demand.

            So, how can we course correct? Sustainable water management by government and industry, 
            cross-border cooperation, nature-based infrastructure and mindful consumer habits are 
            all critical for rebalancing our water budget. A concerted global effort could deliver 
            water security for all, and sanitation for the 3 billion people who still lack it, as 
            soon as 2030. And it won’t break the bank, costing just over 1% of global GDP, 
            according to <a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/01/cost-to-solve-global-water-crisis" target="_blank">WRI</a>.
