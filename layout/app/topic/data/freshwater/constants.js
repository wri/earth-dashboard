           Almost half of humanity (3.6 billion people) lives in areas likely to run short of water at least one 
           month a year. By withdrawing more water than the land can naturally replenish, we have created 
           humanitarian crises and security risks <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paullaudicina/2018/06/07/water-day-zero-coming-to-a-city-near-you/#5df9cd5c1738" target="_blank">around the world</a>. From Bangalore 
           to Beijing, <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/africa/cape-town-day-zero-crisis-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Cape Town</a> to 
           California and Melbourne to Mexico City water shortages and even rationing are commonplace. Nature 
           is suffering, too, with freshwater species declining faster than their ocean or forest 
           cousins—<a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/freshwater" target="_blank">by 84%, on average</a>, since 1970.

            Food demand is driving the water deficit, with agriculture responsible for <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture#:~:text=In%20most%20regions%20of%20the,percent%20increase%20in%20water%20withdrawals." target="_blank">70% of freshwater use</a>. 
            At the same time, climate change is <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paullaudicina/2018/06/07/water-day-zero-coming-to-a-city-near-you/#5df9cd5c1738" target="_blank">altering the quantity and timing of water flows</a>, leading 
            to more severe droughts and floods and complicating conservation efforts. Our pool of usable water 
            is also shrinking due to pollution from farms and industry that is <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-1-4648-1459-4#:~:text=Quality%20Unknown%3A%20The%20Invisible%20Water%20Crisis%20presents%20new%20evidence%20and,potential%2C%20and%20reduces%20food%20production." target="_blank">triggering chemical overload and coastal dead zones</a>. Within 
            just 10 years, WRI projects, the world’s water supply will fall <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/04/coronavirus-water-scarcity-hand-washing" target="_blank">56% short of human demand</a>.

            So, how can we course correct? Sustainable water management by government and industry, 
            cross-border cooperation, nature-based infrastructure and mindful consumer habits are all critical 
            for rebalancing our water budget. A concerted global effort could deliver water security for all, 
            and sanitation for the 3 billion people who still lack it, as soon as 2030. And it won’t break 
            the bank, costing just over 1% of global GDP annually, according to <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/01/cost-to-solve-global-water-crisis" target="_blank">WRI</a>. But we are not 
            investing enough to close the gap between global renewable water supply and demand. For this 
            we would need to invest $1.04 trillion annually in sustainable water management through 
            2030. (source: <a className="external-link -freshwater" href="https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/achieving-abundance.pdf" target="_blank">Achieving Abundance</a>, WRI)
