            Combating this climate emergency requires a rapid transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. 
            Experts believe we can <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://exponentialroadmap.org/" target="_blank">get halfway there in just ten years</a> by harnessing existing
             technology. Proven policies and solutions are available to <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://exponentialroadmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ExponentialRoadmap_1.5.1_216x279_08_AW_Download_Singles_Small.pdf" target="_blank">transform energy supply, industry, 
             buildings, transport and food consumption</a>. Nature-based solutions such as sustainable farming
              practices and reforestation can help cut emissions and expand carbon sinks.

            Yet, there is little evidence that governments, corporations and citizens are ready and willing
             to commit the resources, and embrace the economic and industrial upheaval required. As our chart
              above shows, time is of the essence, with each degree of warming multiplying climate threats
             and impacts. <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://earth.org/for-every-1c-rise-in-temperature-a-billion-people-will-endure-insufferable-heat/" target="_blank">Every 1°C rise in temperature makes the world less habitable for a billion people</a>.
             Faced with this prospect, countries, corporations and citizens must work together
             to realize a post fossil fuels era.

export const CLIMATE_METHODOLOGY_DATA = <p>
    Data for historical temperature anomalies and future projections are taken from Figure 12.5 of <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">IPCC report AR5 Climate Change 2013</a>. The 
    original baseline of the figure (1986- 2005) was modified to account for pre-industrial warming
     (since 1850-1900) by adding 0.65ºC to all values, following <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3024/6fe51fca5cd4f25eb56999b9dbe163e53014.pdf?_ga=2.229101076.980227755.1605691335-447938515.1605691335" target="_blank">Schurer et al. (2017)</a>. The climate scenario shown is RCP 6.0 where the solid line represents the
      multi-model mean and the shadowed areas represent the 5 to 95% range (±1.64 standard deviation).
