            Climate change is triggering rising sea levels, acidified oceans, deadly heat waves, 
            fiercer droughts and storms and unprecedented <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/climate/australia-wildfires-climate-change.html" target="_blank">wildfires</a>. 
            The world is inching <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0" target="_blank">closer to nine irreversible climate tipping points</a>, 
            among them survival of the Amazon and boreal forests, large-scale ice loss in the 
            Arctic and Greenland and permafrost thaw. 
        </p>,

            Combating this climate emergency requires a rapid transition to net zero greenhouse
             gas emissions. Experts believe we can <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://exponentialroadmap.org/">get halfway there in just ten years</a> by harnessing 
             existing technology. Proven policies and solutions are available to 
             <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://exponentialroadmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ExponentialRoadmap_1.5.1_216x279_08_AW_Download_Singles_Small.pdf">
            transform energy supply, industry, buildings, transport and food consumption</a>. 
            Nature-based solutions such as sustainable farming practices and reforestation can help cut emissions and expand carbon sinks.

            The global economic benefit of such initiatives could be <a className="external-link -climate" href="https://exponentialroadmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ExponentialRoadmap_1.5.1_216x279_08_AW_Download_Singles_Small.pdf" target="_blank">as high as US$26 trillion by 2030</a>. 
            Yet, there is little evidence that governments, corporations and citizens are ready and willing 
            to commit the finance, and embrace the economic and industrial upheaval required. As our chart 
            above shows, time is of the essence, with each degree of warming multiplying climate threats and 
            impacts. Every 1°C rise in temperature makes the world less habitable for a billion people. 
            Faced with this prospect, countries, corporations and citizens must work together to realize 
            a post fossil fuels era.
