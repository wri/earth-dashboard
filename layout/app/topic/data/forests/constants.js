    description: `The world’s forest cover has halved from 6 trillion trees 10,000 years ago to to 3 trillion trees today. In recent years, many countries, led by China and India, have launched regreening efforts. But the loss and degradation of primary forests housing 80% of global biodiversity and huge carbon reservoirs continues apace. The Amazon - the most biodiverse place on Earth -  typifies this trend, triggered mainly by global demand for food and fuel. From Brazil to California, forest fires exacerbated by changing climatic conditions are also fueling the destruction. `
