            The world’s forest cover has halved from 6 trillion trees 10,000 years ago to to 3 trillion trees
             today. In recent years, <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/human-activity-in-china-and-india-dominates-the-greening-of-earth-nasa-study-shows" target="_blank">China, India</a> and
              other countries have launched regreening efforts. But the <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019" target="_blank">loss</a> and 
              degradation of primary forests - home to 80% of global biodiversity and <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1203&context=natlpark" target="_blank">half of all carbon</a> stored
             on land - continues apace. The Amazon, the <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/ecoregions/ecology-amazon-rainforest#:~:text=The%20most%20biodiverse%20place%20on,forest%20habitats%20of%20the%20region" target="_blank">most biodiverse place on Earth</a>, 
             typifies this trend, which is driven mainly by global demand for food and fuel. From Brazil to California, <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1chEx2Aewehp1_0nXYnERwUViJI6qR2hi/view" target="_blank">forest fires</a> worsened

            <a className="external-link -forests" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/" target="_blank">Trees now blanket</a> just 30.8% of land, 
            down from 32.5% in 1990. Of what remains, just a third are primary forests. The harmful impacts are already 
            immense - on <a className="external-link -forests" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/#:~:text=Between%202015%20and%202020%2C%20the,80%20million%20hectares%20since%201990" target="_blank">86 million forest-based livelihoods</a>,

        </p>,
        <p>
            To preserve our last primary forests, and prevent forest loss everywhere, governments and corporations must 
            adopt new policies and business models that recognize the value of global commons. All future decisions that 
            impact forests should weigh the many benefits they deliver against the costs to people and our planet of their overuse.
