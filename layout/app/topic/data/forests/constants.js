        Tree cover loss, especially in irreplaceable primary forests rich in species and carbon, is a planetary emergency. In 2019, tropical rainforests vanished at the rate of one football pitch (soccer field) <a className="external-link -white" target="_blank" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019">every six seconds</a>. But forests face a double threat. Climate change can bring droughts to rainforests, reducing their ability to store carbon.  The Amazon is on course to transform from a carbon sink to source as soon as 2035.

        <p>
            Over the past 10,000 years, the world’s forest cover has shrunk by half. In recent years, China, 
            India and other countries <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/human-activity-in-china-and-india-dominates-the-greening-of-earth-nasa-study-shows">have launched regreening efforts</a>. But 
            the <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019" target="_blank">loss</a> and degradation 
            of primary forests - home to <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation-and-forest-degradation" target="_blank">80% of terrestrial species</a> and 
            <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1203&context=natlpark" target="_blank">half of all carbon</a> stored 
            on land - continues apace. 
        </p>,
        <p>
            The Amazon forest typifies this trend.  It is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on earth, home
             to millions of species of plants and animals with unique properties and potential that scientists
              have only begun to explore.  The forest regulates rainfall, absorbs 5% of the world’s carbon
             emissions, and produces 20% of its oxygen.  But already, 17% of the forest has been destroyed, 
             this process is accelerating, and scientists <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/eaat2340" target="_blank">warn</a> that losing 20 to 25 percent of the Amazon’s
             original forest cover could transform the system from tropical rain forest to savanna. Trees
             cleared and fires set by humans to meet global demand for food and fuel are bringing us closer
             to this tipping point.
        </p>,
        <p>
            <a className="external-link -forests" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/" target="_blank">Trees now blanket</a> just 30.8% of land, down from 32.5% in 1990. Of what remains, just a third 
            are primary forests. The harmful impacts are already immense - on <a className="external-link -forests" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/#:~:text=Between%202015%20and%202020%2C%20the,80%20million%20hectares%20since%201990" target="_blank">86 million forest-based livelihoods</a>, on
             food and water security, <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019" target="_blank">on the Earth’s climate regulation</a> and on the lost genetic potential stored in
              disappearing forests. 
        </p>,
        <p>
            To preserve our last primary forests, and prevent forest loss everywhere, governments and corporations must adopt new policies and business models that recognize the value of global commons. All future decisions that impact forests should weigh the many benefits they deliver against the costs to people and our planet of their overuse.

    The map of the Amazon was created using <a className="external-link -forests bold" href="https://data.apps.fao.org/aquamaps/" target="_blank">FAO Aquamaps</a> Major 
    Hydrological Basins dataset. Visualizations of tree cover loss and associated drivers drew on global 
    tree cover data from <a className="external-link -forests bold" href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UMD_hansen_global_forest_change_2019_v1_7#citations" target="_blank">Hansen et al</a>. 
    and <a className="external-link -forests bold" href="https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/global-2010-tree-cover-30-m" target="_blank">University of Maryland GLAD</a> laboratory. 
    The Amazon carbon sink to source line chart was inspired by Figure 3 of <a className="external-link -forests bold" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2035-0" target="_blank">Hubau et al (2019)</a> with
