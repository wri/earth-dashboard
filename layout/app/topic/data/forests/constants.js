        Tree cover loss, especially in irreplaceable primary forests rich in species 
        and carbon, is a planetary emergency. In 2019, tropical rainforests vanished 
        at the rate of one football pitch (soccer field) every six seconds (Source: <a className="external-link" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019" target="_blank">GFW</a>). 
        But forests face a double threat. Climate change can bring droughts to rainforests, 
        reducing their ability to store carbon.  The Amazon is on course to transform from a 
        carbon sink to source as soon as 2035.

        <p>
            The world’s forest cover has halved from 6 trillion trees 10,000 years ago to to 3 trillion trees
             today. In recent years, <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/human-activity-in-china-and-india-dominates-the-greening-of-earth-nasa-study-shows" target="_blank">China, India</a> and
              other countries have launched regreening efforts. But the <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2019" target="_blank">loss</a> and 
              degradation of primary forests - home to 80% of global biodiversity and <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1203&context=natlpark" target="_blank">half of all carbon</a> stored
             on land - continues apace. The Amazon, the <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/ecoregions/ecology-amazon-rainforest#:~:text=The%20most%20biodiverse%20place%20on,forest%20habitats%20of%20the%20region" target="_blank">most biodiverse place on Earth</a>, 
             typifies this trend, which is driven mainly by global demand for food and fuel. From Brazil to California, <a className="external-link -forests" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1chEx2Aewehp1_0nXYnERwUViJI6qR2hi/view" target="_blank">forest fires</a> worsened
              by changing climatic conditions are fueling the destruction.

        <p>
            <a className="external-link -forests" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/" target="_blank">Trees now blanket</a> just 30.8% of land, 
            down from 32.5% in 1990. Of what remains, just a third are primary forests. The harmful impacts are already 
            immense - on <a className="external-link -forests" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/#:~:text=Between%202015%20and%202020%2C%20the,80%20million%20hectares%20since%201990" target="_blank">86 million forest-based livelihoods</a>,

        </p>,
        <p>
            To preserve our last primary forests, and prevent forest loss everywhere, governments and corporations must 
            adopt new policies and business models that recognize the value of global commons. All future decisions that 
            impact forests should weigh the many benefits they deliver against the costs to people and our planet of their overuse.
