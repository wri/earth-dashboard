                This is a map of the Amazon region in South America. The <strong>Amazon rainforest</strong> covers 597 Mha across nine countries and harbors 16,000 tree species.

                The tiny trees here represent the estimated 514 Mha of <strong>tree cover present in the Amazon in the year 2000</strong>. That would be a tree cover area equivalent to <strong>12.5 Californias</strong>

                To get an idea of the scale, <strong>one tree</strong> represents 4.2 million Ha of tree cover, equivalent to <strong>an area the size of Switzerland</strong>

                Letâ€™s fast forward to 2019. This is how much of that 2000 tree cover is left. In these nineteen years, <strong>the Amazon has lost an area equivalent to the size of 9 Switzerlands since 2000</strong>.            </p>
