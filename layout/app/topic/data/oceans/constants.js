    description: `The ocean covers 70% of our planet. Its abundance offers solutions to pressing global challenges including surging food and energy demand and climate change mitigation. Research suggests the emerging science of mariculture (ocean aquaculture) could help deliver over 6 times more food than the ocean provides us today. On the climate front, investment in sustainable, ocean-based foods and ecosystems, wind and wave energy, ocean transport and seabed carbon storage, could deliver 21% of emission cuts needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. `
