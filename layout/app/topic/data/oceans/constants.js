            The ocean covers 70% of our planet. Yet ocean health is declining as humanity <a className="external-link -oceans" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332219302751" target="_blank">exploits and pollutes marine life</a>. 
            Tipping points are approaching for coral reef survival and ocean acidification as climate 
            change warms waters. Nearly <a className="external-link -oceans" href="http://www.secore.org/site/corals/detail/coral-reefs-are-dying.23.html" target="_blank">50 percent of the world’s coral</a> 
            has died in the last 30 years; Farm waste is fuelling hundreds of low-oxygen dead zones, 
            some stretching for thousands of kilometers.  Since the 1970s, the area these 
            cover has nearly doubled every year.  A third of UN-monitored fish stocks are 
            <a className="external-link -oceans" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/" target="_blank">harvested beyond sustainable levels</a> 
            while unregulated fishing <a className="external-link -oceans" href="https://news.mongabay.com/2019/10/commitments-worth-63-billion-pledged-for-ocean-protection/" target="_blank">traps up to 26 million tons of fish a year</a>. 
            And a garbage truck's worth of plastic <a className="external-link -oceans" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ocean-fact-sheet-package.pdf" target="_blank">enters the ocean every minute</a>, 
            harming marine life with unknown consequences.

            The ocean offers solutions to pressing global challenges including surging food and energy 
            demand and climate change mitigation. Research suggests the emerging science of mariculture 
            (ocean aquaculture) could help <a className="external-link -oceans" href="https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/Food%20from%20the%20Sea%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">deliver over 6 times more food</a> 
            than the ocean provides us today. On the climate front, investment in sustainable, 
            ocean-based foods and ecosystems, wind and wave energy, ocean transport and seabed carbon storage, 
            <a className="external-link -oceans" href="https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/HLP_Report_Ocean_Solution_Climate_Change_final.pdf" target="_blank">could deliver 21% of emission</a> 
            cuts needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.  To bring about this future, we need a healthy and bountiful ocean.
        </p>,
        <p>
            Governments, companies and citizens must act with urgency to slow these negative human pressures, 
            in order to sustain the ocean and its potential to deliver new industries, jobs and food and 
            energy security. This endeavor will be well worth the cost: <a className="external-link -oceans" href="https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/Ocean%20Panel_Economic%20Analysis_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">every $ spent on a sustainable ocean economy could yield five times the return in benefits</a>.
