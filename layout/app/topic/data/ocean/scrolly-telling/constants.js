                        Humans are using the oceans and exploiting their resources in a variety of ways and at an
                        unprecedented pace. Human impacts have surged since 1970, along with the hope that the
                        ocean can deliver as an economic frontier, but accumulating pressures on fragile and finite
                        resources are creating mounting risks.

                         caused by climate change.  Rising temperatures bleach the coral killing the algae that keep
                         it alive. At the same time <strong>the oceanâ€™s chemistry is changing faster than at any time in the last
                          50 million years</strong>. Excess carbon dioxide absorbed by ocean water is lowering its pH and locking
                         up the carbonate ions sea creatures need to extract to build shells and reefs.

                        Between 1970 and 2012, populations of fish and other marine vertebrates such as mammals, reptiles
                        and birds <a className="external-link -ocean" href="http://ocean.panda.org.s3.amazonaws.com/media/Living_Blue_Planet_Report_2015_08_31.pdf" target="_blank">fell by half</a> (Source: Living Blue Planet Report). <strong>Overfishing is a key reason</strong>.

                    <p>
                        In 1974, only one in ten UN-monitored fish stocks were harvested beyond sustainable levels. Today more
                         than one in three are. This means that they <a className="external-link -ocean" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/" target="_blank">cannot reproduce as fast as they are being killed</a>.

                        throughout the ocean, swirling with the currents into islands of plastic as large
                        as millions of km across.

                    <p>
                        If this continues, <strong>by 2025 there could be one ton of plastic in the ocean for every three tons of fish</strong>.

                        sea turtles and fish. Micro-plastic particles they ingest also pose a threat to humans.

                        Such investments would be enormously cost-effective: on average, the benefits would be
                        five times greater than the costs. As shown here, benefit/cost ratios would vary,
                        ranging from 3-to-1 to more than 12-to-1.
