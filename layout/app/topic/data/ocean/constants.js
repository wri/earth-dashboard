            The ocean covers 70% of our planet. Yet ocean health is declining as humanity <a className="external-link -ocean" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332219302751" target="_blank">exploits and pollutes marine life</a>. Nearly 
            half <a className="external-link -ocean" href="http://www.secore.org/site/corals/detail/coral-reefs-are-dying.23.html" target="_blank">of the world’s coral</a> has died in the last 30 years. Farm waste is fuelling hundreds of 
             low-oxygen dead zones. Some stretch for thousands of kilometers and the area these cover has nearly <a className="external-link -ocean" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/oceans/dead-zones/" target="_blank">doubled every decade</a> since
              the 1960s. A third of UN-monitored fish stocks are <a className="external-link -ocean" href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-fisheries-aquaculture/en/" target="_blank">harvested beyond sustainable levels</a>, 
             and unregulated fishing <a className="external-link -ocean" href="https://news.mongabay.com/2019/10/commitments-worth-63-billion-pledged-for-ocean-protection/" target="_blank">traps up to 26 million tons of fish</a> a year. If this plastic pollution continues at the
              present rate, by 2025, there could be one ton of plastic in the ocean for every three tons of fish. 
              Plastic bags, fishing nets, and other debris choke, strangle and poison, seabirds, sea turtles and fish. 
              Micro-plastic particles sea creatures ingest also pose a threat to humans.

            The ocean offers solutions to pressing global challenges.  It can help mitigate demand and meet surging 
            demand for food and energy. Research suggests the emerging science of mariculture (ocean aquaculture)
             could help <a className="external-link -ocean" href="https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/Food%20from%20the%20Sea%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">deliver over 6 times more food</a> than the ocean provides us today. On the climate front, 
             investment in sustainable, ocean-based foods and ecosystems, wind and wave energy, ocean transport
              and seabed carbon storage, <a className="external-link -ocean" href="https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/HLP_Report_Ocean_Solution_Climate_Change_final.pdf" target="_blank">could deliver 21% of emission cuts</a> needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
               To bring about this future, we need a healthy and bountiful ocean.
